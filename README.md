# WashingtonPostPoliceShootingsProject

Overview
This study uses The Washington Postâ€™s database to perform exploratory data analysis and build a logistic regression model to investigate the impact of demographic variables on the likelihood of being armed and shot by police while fleeing. Key findings indicate that gender and race significantly predict these outcomes, with control variables enhancing the model's validity by reducing bias.

Dataset
The dataset, sourced from The Washington Post, includes records of fatal police shootings in the U.S. since January 1, 2015. It tracks over a dozen details for each incident, including race, circumstances, mental health status, and whether the individual was armed or fleeing. This dataset is more comprehensive than other sources, documenting over twice as many incidents on average annually.

Data Preparation
Cleaning: We filtered the dataset to remove null values and focus on fleeing victims, resulting in 3,393 observations.
Features: Included variables like age, race, gender, mental illness, and armed status.
Exploration: Conducted various visualizations, including bar charts and maps, to analyze the role of race among fleeing victims.
Analysis
Visualizations: Created to show racial disparities in fleeing victims, including comparisons between Black and White individuals.
Logistic Regression: Used to model the probability of being armed and shot by police, controlling for gender, race, mental illness, and other variables.

Contributions
This study enhances understanding of systemic police violence and racial inequalities in the U.S. by identifying factors influencing the likelihood of being shot by police when fleeing. It contributes to the literature on police killings and aims to inform future research and policy discussions on police violence and demographic disparities.
